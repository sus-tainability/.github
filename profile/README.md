# EcoQuest
Welcome to EcoQuest, a community-based game that promotes sustainable living by engaging users in activities that encourage responsible consumption.

## Demo
- [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2bNogfSkVE)
- [Live Application](http://sus-tainability.netlify.app)

## Motivation
Despite understanding the importance of sustainability, consumers struggle to take action due to various challenges such as a lack of belief in individual impact, lack of understanding of how to contribute, and inconvenience of sustainable practices. If not addressed, these issues can lead to a negative impact on the environment and future generations.

Our mobile application is designed to motivate users to engage in sustainable behaviors through gamification and positive reinforcement. Our solution aligns with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Targets, including promoting responsible consumption and production patterns (SDG 12, Target 12.5), improving education and awareness around climate change (SDG 13, Target 13.3), and protecting threatened species and reducing the degradation of natural habitats (SDG 15, Target 15.5).
